# This repo contains the query_permutes() function

Expression_Enrichment.md: This function allows the user to check whether certain expression libraries are enriched within subsets of the genome

TAIR_trawler.md: This script allows the user to check whether clusters of genes homologous to certain TAIR homologs are enriched within subsets of the genome

# Files:

*All_Eugene_Homolog_Clusters.txt:* Clusters of homologs inside 12 *Helianthus* haploblocks generated with *TAIR_trawler* from the filtered Eugene Ha412 annotation. FDR-corrected enrichment p-value<0.01, clusters with minimum 3 copies, annotated with TAIR homolog descriptions.
